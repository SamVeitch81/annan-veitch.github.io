# Badger Banter

**Welcome** to a tiny corner of the internet where two badgers argue about snacks, hats, and minor celebrity.

## Conversation

**Alf** — the one with suspiciously neat stripes  
Evening. I dug up a treasure chest of worms. It came with an instruction leaflet in Latin. Should I read it aloud?

**Bea** — connoisseur of compost and dramatic pauses  
Only if it contains a recipe. Otherwise, hum the national anthem of the hedgehogs and eat first, ask questions later.

**Alf**  
I once tried wearing a top hat. The worms applauded. The owl took notes. I think I'm on the verge of fame.

**Bea**  
Fame is overrated. Fame means autograph requests at 3am and fewer comfortable burrows. Stay earthy, Alf.

**Alf**  
Fair. But if you become famous, will you mention me in your inevitable memoir, *From Sett to Stardom*?

**Bea**  
Only if you promise not to use my real name. "Beatrice of the Bog" will do nicely.
